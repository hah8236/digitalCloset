Title - Digital Closet

Features:
The user may add new items to their closet, remove an item from their closet,
log an item as worn, search for items in closet, and print portions of their 
closet.

Garment Types:
Articles of clothing added to a user's closet may be placed into
1 of 6 different categories:
1) Tops
2) Bottoms
3) Full Body (Dresses, Suits, Jumpsuits, etc.)
4) Outerwear (Jackets, Vests, etc.)
5) Shoes
6) Accessories

WARNING:
Entering an item as the name 'exit' (in any casing - including EXIT, exIT, etc.)
will result in an error.
Entering an item as a name that another item of that type already has will
result in improper tracking.
